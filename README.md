# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-Project
This project uses R to predict heart attack risk based on patient data. We applied Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Regression to analyze features like cholesterol, BMI, and exercise habits. The report includes preprocessing, model evaluation, and insights for early risk detection.
